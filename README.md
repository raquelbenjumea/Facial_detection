# Facial_detection

In this github we analize different types of models to predict facial emotions. At the beggining we analize this emotions in a discrete way using the following models:
- VGG
- Resnet (and its derivates like Resnet18, Resnet18 with wieght dekay, Resnet50...)
- MobileNet
- CNN
- EfficientNet

Then, there is a transformation of the dataset to discrete to continuous.

Using this new dataset we have trained into three different models: VGG, Resnet and CNN.
Finally we intented to create new data using GANs.
